- 8f9d96d: feat(admin): fix admin panel type safety, lint warnings, and external auth flow integration

  Refactored the admin panel and core SDK interfaces to eliminate compiler errors and ESLint warnings (such as `any` usage, index signature mismatches, and regex escapes). This ensures full compatibility with the updated schema and SDK type definitions, allowing all 20 monorepo packages to build successfully.

  Detailed Changes:
  1. `@dyrected/admin` TypeScript & ESLint Fixes
     - components/media/media-library-dialog.tsx:
       - Replaced `any` in `MediaLibraryDialogProps` (`selectedValues`, `onSelect`, `onConfirm`) with proper typed interfaces (`string | Record<string, unknown>`).
       - Imported `Media` type from `@dyrected/sdk` and typed `selectedItem` state as `(Media & { id?: string }) | null` to resolve missing property compilation errors.
       - Cleaned up regex useless-escape warnings (`no-useless-escape`) in YouTube link detection pattern by removing backslashes on `&` and `?`.
       - Added type assertion to `client.collection(collection).upload(...)` returns and mapped list item elements in loop to define `mimeType?: string`.
       - Restored the original select-to-confirm highlight click logic in single-select mode.
     - pages/collections/edit-page.tsx:
       - Cast `client!.collection(slug!).findOne(id!)` return values to `Promise<Record<string, any> | null>` to resolve property accesses on `unknown`.
       - Replaced `schema.label` fallback checks with the new `schema.labels?.singular` / `schema.labels?.plural` structures.
       - Replaced generic `any` usage in collection schema iteration callbacks with `{ name?: string }` maps.
     - components/forms/field-renderer.tsx:
       - Cast `schema.admin` to resolve union-field layout property checking.
       - Renamed imported type `UrlField` to `UrlFieldSchema` to resolve naming collisions with `UrlFieldComponent`.
     - components/forms/fields/radio-field.tsx:
       - Correctly typed `RadioFieldProps` and cast the `RadioGroup` value to a string.
     - components/forms/fields/media-picker.tsx:
       - Added clean casting of file upload responses to `CachedMedia` type to satisfy the state updater.
  2. Auth, Core, and Router Integration
     - specs/external-admin-auth-door.md & specs/admin-auth.test.ts:
       - Outlined, specified, and integrated the OIDC/Cloud provider handoff, callback, and JIT provisioning authorization contract.
     - packages/core/src/types/admin-auth.ts & packages/core/src/types/documents.ts:
       - Defined schema shapes, request parameters, and controllers for JWT-scoped identity handoff.
     - packages/admin/src/providers/dyrected-context.ts:
       - Extracted provider states into a centralized context to decouple core workspace bindings.
  3. Documentation & Schema Sync
     - Updated MDX docs (`apps/docs/content/docs/*`) to reflect database, storage, and field-rendering layouts.
     - Synchronized knowledge base inventories (`packages/knowledge/generated/*`) and LLM mappings to index new API parameters.

### Patch Changes

- 0b13e96: feat: add customizable field widths to collection edit layouts and unify list page view settings
  - Added customizable field widths (25%, 33%, 50%, 66%, 75%, 100%) to edit forms, enabling side-by-side field positioning.
  - Expanded the layout preferences API and SDK client to handle generic LayoutItem objects (`Array<{ name: string; width?: string }>`).
  - Consolidated the list view mode selector and column configure popovers into a unified "View Settings" panel.
  - Enabled column visibility toggles (checklists) directly inside the new unified view settings popover, syncing visible columns with the data table.

### Minor Changes

- 9fcf1e2: @dyrected/knowledge — minor

  Add @dyrected/knowledge package: compiled recipe library with behavioral tests, intent-indexed search, and a content generator that produces hybrid documentation pages (authored prose + generated TypeScript contracts in marked regions). Includes auto-slug, cross-field validation, dependent dropdown, owner-scoped access, role-based access, editorial workflow, page builder, upload collection, relationship/join, safe field rename, and conditional admin field recipes.

  @dyrected/core — patch

  Expand public type exports (CollectionConfig, GlobalConfig, Field, UploadConfig, workflow types) and extend the OpenAPI generator to include all auth, workflow, schema, and dynamic-option routes.

  @dyrected/sdk — patch

  Remove internal setup-prompt utility (superseded by CLI). Expand public API surface with fluent collection/global builders, authentication helpers, and complete TypeScript generics.

  @dyrected/cli — minor

  Add generate-ai-rules command. Extend init with framework/adapter detection. Add type generator and config templates.

  @dyrected/db-postgres, @dyrected/db-mongodb — patch

  Align adapter implementations with updated DatabaseAdapter contract (transactions, typed return shapes, ReadonlyDatabaseAdapter).

  @dyrected/docs — patch

  Rewrite reference, adapter, recipe, and guide pages as hybrid documents: authored mental models and examples preserved, TypeScript contracts generated into marked regions. Fix MDX region markers from HTML comments to JSX comments ({/\* \*/}) so fumadocs can compile them. Add check-contract.mjs validation: required heading manifests, authored word-count floor, and marker integrity checks.

  skills/dyrected — patch

  Restore full SKILL.md with schema migration procedure, access-control principles, intent-to-pattern table, and generated field/recipe inventories.
