title: Introduction
description: What Dyrected is and how the pieces fit together.
---

Dyrected is a code-first headless CMS. You define your content model in TypeScript — collections, fields, access rules, hooks — and Dyrected generates a REST API, an Admin UI, and a type-safe SDK from it automatically. No clicking through UI builders to create fields.

The engine runs **inside your existing Next.js or Nuxt app** as a route handler. There is no separate CMS server to run.

## How it fits together

**`@dyrected/core`** — the engine. Mount it as a catch-all route in Next.js or as a Nuxt module. It handles the database, REST API, file uploads, auth, and email.

**Admin UI** — auto-generated from your config. Mount it at `/admin`. Your clients use this to edit content. You never have to build a dashboard.

**`@dyrected/sdk`** — a typed TypeScript client for fetching content from your frontend, Node scripts, or any other environment.

**Dyrected Cloud** — optional managed hosting for the database, storage, and multi-site workspaces. If you'd rather manage your own infrastructure, self-hosting is free.
