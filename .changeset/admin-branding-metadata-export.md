Admin: brand accent color, wired page metadata, and list export

- Add `admin.branding.accentColor` — a second brand color for links, navigation accents, and focus rings (mapped to the `--intelligence` token) alongside `primaryColor`. Branding colors now also apply correctly in dark mode.
- Wire `admin.meta.titleSuffix` into the browser tab title (it now reflects the current page and updates on navigation) and `admin.branding.favicon` into the page favicon. Both restore the host page's title/icon when the embedded admin unmounts.
- Add an **Export Selected** bulk action on collection lists (export just the selected rows to CSV), and quote/escape CSV export values per RFC 4180 so values containing commas, quotes, or newlines no longer break columns.

**Breaking (shipped as patch):** removed the no-op `basename` prop from `AdminUIProps` and the `@dyrected/vue` / `@dyrected/nuxt` wrappers, and stopped the CLI from scaffolding it. The admin routes internally with a hash router, so the panel's location is determined by the route of the page you render it in. If your app passes `basename`, remove it — it had no effect.
